1. High-Level Project Summary 
Project Title: Weather Analysis and Visualization for 10 Major Egyptian Cities Using NASA 
Data 
Summary: This project develops a web-based application that uses NASA’s Open-Meteo 
and MODIS satellite data to analyze and visualize rainfall, temperature, and wind speed 
trends across 10 major Egyptian cities. It addresses the challenge of providing accessible 
climate data to inform urban planning and disaster management. The project is important 
because it empowers local authorities with actionable insights, supports sustainable 
development, and helps communities better prepare for extreme weather events. 
2. Project Details 
Project Functionality: The project collects historical and real-time weather data for 10 
major Egyptian cities, including temperature, rainfall, and wind speed. It visualizes trends 
through interactive graphs and heatmaps for easy understanding. 
How it Works: The system fetches data from NASA’s Open-Meteo and MODIS datasets via 
API calls, processes it using Python and pandas, and generates visualizations using Plotly. 
Users can select cities, time ranges, and variables to explore the data interactively. 
Benefits: The project benefits urban planners, researchers, and policymakers by providing 
actionable insights for flood prevention, infrastructure development, and sustainable 
urban growth. 
Goals: The project aims to improve climate awareness, support data-driven decision
making, and demonstrate the practical value of NASA data. 
Tools, Languages, Software Used: Python (pandas, Plotly, requests), Jupyter Notebook, 
Excel for initial data cleaning, NASA Open-Meteo and MODIS APIs, GitHub for version 
control.
