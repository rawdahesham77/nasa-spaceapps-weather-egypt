This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.16.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

1. High-Level Project Summary 
Project Title: Weather Analysis and Visualization for 10 Major Egyptian Cities Using NASA 
Data 
Summary: This project develops a web-based application that uses NASA’s Open-Meteo 
and MODIS satellite data to analyze and visualize rainfall, temperature, and wind speed 
trends across 10 major Egyptian cities. It addresses the challenge of providing accessible 
climate data to inform urban planning and disaster management. The project is important 
because it empowers local authorities with actionable insights, supports sustainable 
development, and helps communities better prepare for extreme weather events. 
2. Project Details 
Project Functionality: The project collects historical and real-time weather data for 10 
major Egyptian cities, including temperature, rainfall, and wind speed. It visualizes trends 
through interactive graphs and heatmaps for easy understanding. 
How it Works: The system fetches data from NASA’s Open-Meteo and MODIS datasets via 
API calls, processes it using Python and pandas, and generates visualizations using Plotly. 
Users can select cities, time ranges, and variables to explore the data interactively. 
Benefits: The project benefits urban planners, researchers, and policymakers by providing 
actionable insights for flood prevention, infrastructure development, and sustainable 
urban growth. 
Goals: The project aims to improve climate awareness, support data-driven decision
making, and demonstrate the practical value of NASA data. 
Tools, Languages, Software Used: Python (pandas, Plotly, requests), Jupyter Notebook, 
Excel for initial data cleaning, NASA Open-Meteo and MODIS APIs, GitHub for version 
control. 
3. NASA Data 
Data Sources Used: 
1. MODIS Satellite Imagery - https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/ 
2. NASA Open-Meteo Historical Weather API - https://open
meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api 
3. Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) - https://gpm.nasa.gov/data 
Usage: Data from NASA was used to extract historical and real-time weather parameters 
for analysis and visualization, including temperature, rainfall, and wind speed. 
4. Space Agency Partner & Other Data 
Other Data Sources: 
• Open-Meteo API for historical weather data of 10 Egyptian cities. 
• Excel spreadsheets for initial data cleaning and preprocessing. 
Tools: 
• Front end and backend  
• Power bi and excel  
• GitHub for version control 
5. Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
AI Tools Used: No advanced AI tools were used in this project. Data processing and 
visualization were done using standard Python libraries and APIs.
